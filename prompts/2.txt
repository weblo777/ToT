You now have 3 ideas. Please consider a 3 factors such as achievable, feasible and innovative for each solution other most important judging and score ranking criteria. For each of the three following proposed solutions, evaluate their potential. Consider the pros and cons, initial effort needed, implementation difficulty, feasibility, potential challenges, and the overall value. Assign a probability of success using a grade of 1 through 100 and a confidence level to each option based on these evaluations.  At each step state the exact number of loops that have occurred and the total cumulative number of loops.
