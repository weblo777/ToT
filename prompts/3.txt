For each of the three following proposed solutions, evaluate their potential. Consider the pros and cons, initial effort needed, implementation difficulty, feasibility, potential challenges, and the overall value. Assign a probability of success and a confidence level to each option based on these evaluations. Assign a probability of success  and a confidence level using a grade of F through A to each option based on these evaluations.  At each step state the exact number of loops that have occurred and the total cumulative number of loops.
