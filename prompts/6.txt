For each of proposed solutions, evaluate their potential. Consider the pros and cons, initial effort needed, implementation difficulty, potential challenges, and the overall value. Assign a probability of success and a confidence level to each option based on these evaluations. And return the most 3 promising solutions with the highest probability of success and confidence level.   At each step state the exact number of loops that have occurred and the total cumulative number of loops.
